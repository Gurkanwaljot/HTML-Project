            <h2 class="h2">THE THREE FARM BILLLS</h2>
            <h3 class="h3">What are the Three Farm Bills?</h3>
            <p class="p">In <i>September, 2020</i> the ruling BJP government forcefully passed three laws in the<i> Lok
                    Sabha</i> and<i> Rajya Sabha</i> assembly despite of the large scale protests by opposition members.
                The government is in belief that they have given independence to the farmers by implementing these laws
                as a farmer can now feel free to sell the produce anywhere in the country without any restictions.
                However, the farmers have a opposite viewpoint which correctly defines the actual purpose of the
                implemented laws. They believe that the instead of farmers, private sectors now have freedom to buy
                produce from anywhere in India at their own terms and price along with freedom to store the produce
                anywhere according to their own choice without any restrition on storing quantity. This means the market
                can be easily <em>manipulated</em> by them in order to gain more profit. More information about the laws
                is mentioned below. </p>
            <dl>
                <dt class="dt">Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce Bill</dt>
                <dd class="dd">It is the first bill implemented among the three bills by the government. This farm bill
                    is defined
                    to give farmer right to sell their produce in other states apart from their local areas. This law is
                    facing great criticism because it is completely destroying the previous <em>Mandi System</em> which
                    is the
                    best known system around the world, giving corporates opportunity to create their own private
                    markets
                    without any proper documnetation or licensing leaving farmers exposed to get exploited.
                </dd>
                <dt class="dt">Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act
                </dt>
                <dd class="dd">It is the second bill among these bills. This farm bill is defined to implement
                    <em>Contract Farming</em>
                    system through agreement betwwen the farmer and buyer. This bill is criticised by the farmers
                    because in this act there is a provision that if anyone the buyer or the farmer violates the
                    agreement,
                    they don't have the right to appeal in any court (<i>Local, State or National courts</i>) and can
                    just
                    complain about it to the local officer who will address matter on his own. Farmers have a
                    fear that if they make a agreement with a multinatinal company or any other big buyer and they violate
                    the
                    agreement and try to exploit the farmer top sell their produce at low prices, how could he just get
                    his complain solved by a local
                    officer against a big corporate?, as he know that it is practically impossible for him because these
                    corporates will have the
                    power and money to bribe the local officers and thus increasing problems for him.
                </dd>
                <dt class="dt">Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act</dt>
                <dd class="dd">It is the third bill among these bills. This is a bill made for ammendment in
                    <em>Essential Commodities Act</em> which earlier had certain restrictions in how much quantity of
                    food grains or any other food stuff a government or any citizen of the country could store. However,
                    the amendment bill now removes these restrictions and these would be implemented only during any
                    natural calamity, any or during an other crisis according to the ammendment.This ammnedment is also facing great
                    criticism because government explains this act by saying that the farmers can store their produce at
                    their own places without any restriction and sell it whenever they find the price to reasonable for
                    their produce. However, the farmers union are criticising the act because most of the farmers in
                    country have a land less that 5 accres which means they don't have enough resources to store their
                    porduce at their homes for long time so their is no meaning for this act for them, but when looked
                    from the side of a buyer, he got freedom to stock grains in any quantity in his own stores and thus
                    could easily
                    manipulate the market in order to gain more profit and increasing debt on the commom man's pocket.
