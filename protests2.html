            <h2 class="h2">PROTESTS IN PUNJAB</h2>
            <h3 class="h3">First Phase of Protests</h3>
            <p class="p">The first phase of the portests began in the state of punjab on small scale when these bills were made
                public in August with small <i>Farmers' Union</i> protesting in their local areas. At the first phase,
                most of the people were unaware of these new laws so protests were limited to small areas.
                Howeever the implementation of the all these laws in a unconstitutional way initiated the second
                phase of the protests in which awareness was the main motive.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">The Second Phase of Protests</h3>
            <p class="p">On 17 September, 2020 the three bills were passed in First House of the parliament and after that on 20
                September, 2020 these were also passed forcibly in the Second House inspite of the large scale
                opposition by the opposition party members. Eventually, the protests got raged when the <em>President of
                India</em> signed the bills and made them laws of the country ignoring the anger of the farmers against these laws . This marked
                the beginning of second phase of the protests. Toll Palazas, Railways, Supermarkets (Big corporate's supermarkets only) etc. were closed everywhere in the state in
                order to create pressure on the <i>Central Government</i> so that they repeal the black laws.</p>
            <h3 class="h4">Beginning of Awareness about the laws</h3>
            <p class="p">Apart from the protests, another movemnet was organised by the Farmers' Unions in order to aware every
                farmer about these black laws around the whole country. Various meetings, gatherings etc. were organised
                in alomost every village around the country in order to aware the people about these black laws so that
                if the governmnet remains still their decision people should be made prepared for the most crucial phase
                of the protests. </p>
            <h4 class="h4">Role of Artists in Awareness Movement</h4>
            <p class="p">Although the Farmers' Unions were trying their best to make people aware about these laws but there was a
                need of certain people who could encourage the youth to take part in these protests. This role was
                fullfilled by the people such as <i>singers, actors, philospphers, economists etc.</i> who were a role model
                for the today's youth. They participated in the gatherings, sang songs related to the protests, wrote
                articles about the effects of the laws and even also partiicpated in the protests leaving their career
                aside in order to encourage the youth which is the backbone of the whole country. </p>
            <h4 class="h4">Government Response to the protests</h4>
            <p class="p">The widespread portests around the Punjab made a great loss to the <em>Central Government</em> but still they
                didn't accepted the farmers' demands at all. Meetings were organised with Farmers' Unions and benefits
                of the laws were tried to explain to the unions but the unions didn't stood on anything till the laws
                were repealled back.So, government started propagating against the protestors through media which is
                completely under their control. This further raged the anger of the faremrs and made the beginning of
                the third phase which popularised the portests around the world and increased the trouble for the
                governmnet. </p>
